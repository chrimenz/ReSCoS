# ReSCoS - Really-Simple-Cooperative-Scheduler
Implementation of a simple cooperative scheduler 

This Repository contains two implementations of a simple scheduler. One for MSP430 (Launchpad) and one for a Cortex-M3-Device (Stellaris). The scheduler can easily be adopted to other platforms by calling the vScdlTick1ms()-Function i.e. from a timer interrupt.
